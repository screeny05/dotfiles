<h1 id="modes">Modes</h1>
<p>
The Premiumize.me Chrome Extension operates in 3 different modes.
</p>
<h2>Inactive (direct mode)</h2>
<p>You are directly connected to the internet, our plugin is inactive</p>
<h2>Auto Mode</h2>
<p>You automatically surf over the correct country for the websites that we list under our supported sites section in the member area on the website.</p>
<p>Downloads also work instantly and are routed over the best server for your location and internet provider.</p>
<h3>Country Mode</h3>
<p>Sometimes it may happen that you want to visit a site that is restricted to a certain country, but we do not have it as a supported site.</p>
<p>In this case you can configure our extension so that all your surfing goes over server in the country of your choosing.</p>
<p>Please note: In this mode also sites that we normally would direct over other countries, are directed over the country of your choice and may therefore not work. Also direct download features are not active in this mode.</p>
